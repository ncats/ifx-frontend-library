              allows federal agencies to use session and persistent cookies.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you visit any website, its server may generate a piece of
              text known as a “cookie” to place on your computer. The cookie
              allows the server to “remember” specific information about your
              visit while you are connected.
            </p>
            <p>
              The cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of
              Web pages. Cookies from NCATS Web pages only collect information
              about your browser’s visit to the site; they do not collect
              personal information about you.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two types of cookies, single-session (temporary) and
              multi-session (persistent). Session cookies last only as long as
              your Web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the cookie
              disappears. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer for
              longer periods.
            </p>
            <p>
              Session Cookies: We use session cookies for technical purposes,
              such as to enable better navigation through our site. These
              cookies let our server know that you are continuing a visit to our
              site. The OMB memo 10-22 guidance defines use of session cookies
              as "Usage Tier 1—Single Session.” The policy says, “This tier
              encompasses any use of single session Web measurement and
              customization technologies.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Persistent Cookies: We use persistent cookies to enable Google
              Analytics to differentiate between new and returning ncats.nih.gov
              visitors. Persistent cookies remain on your computer between
              visits to this website until they expire. The OMB memo 10-22
              guidance defines use of persistent cookies as "Usage Tier
              2—Multi-session without Personally Identifiable Information
              (PII).” The policy says, “This tier encompasses any use of
              multi-session Web measurement and customization technologies when
              no PII is collected.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Opt-Out or Disable Cookies: If you do not wish to have session or
              persistent cookies placed on your computer, you can disable them
              using your Web browser. If you opt out of cookies, you will still
              have access to all information and resources at ncats.nih.gov.
